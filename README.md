### How to calculate a irrational number in binary:

*To convert integer to binary, start with the integer in question and divide it by 2 keeping notice of the quotient and the remainder. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero. Then just write out the remainders in the reverse order.* 

Here is an example of such conversion using the integer 12.

First, letâ€™s divide the number by two specifying quotient and remainder:

- $12 / 2 = 6$ rest $0$
- $6 / 2 = 3$ rest $0$
- $3 / 2 = 1$ rest $1$
- $1 / 2 = 0$ rest $1$

So we've to write it in the reverse order, 12 in binary is 1100

Example: Calculate 0.625 in binary:

- $0.625 * 2 = 1.250$ keep $1$
- $0.250 * 2 = 0.5$ keep $0$
- $0.5 * 2 = 1$ keep $1$

So, 0.625 in binary is 0.101

Example: Calculate 0.505 in binary:
- $0.525 * 2 = 1.050$ keep $1$
- $0.050 * 2 = 0.1$ keep $0$
- $0.1 * 2 = 0.2$ keep $0$
- $0.2 * 2 = 0.4$ keep $0$
- $0.4 * 2 = 0.8$ keep $0$
- $0.8 * 2 = 1.6$ keep $1$
- $0.6 * 2 = 1.2$ keep $1$
- $0.2 * 2 = 1.2$ keep $1$
